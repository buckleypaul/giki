## Step 1: Project scaffold, Go module, Makefile
**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Phase:** Phase 1 - Foundation

**Summary:**
- Initialized Go module: `github.com/buckleypaul/giki`
- Created directory structure: `cmd/giki/`, `internal/{cli,server,git,config}/`, `ui/`
- Implemented minimal `cmd/giki/main.go` that prints "giki"
- Created `Makefile` with targets: `build`, `dev`, `test`, `clean`, `frontend-build`, `frontend-dev`
- Created `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts and frontend dependencies
- Created `architecture.md` with initial project overview and directory structure
- Created `progress-log.md` (this file)

**Test Results:**
- ✓ `go build ./cmd/giki` succeeded
- ✓ `go vet ./...` passed with no issues
- ✓ `make build` produced `giki` binary (2.5M)
- ✓ Binary runs and outputs "giki" as expected

**Next Step:** Step 2 - GitHub repository setup

## Step 2: GitHub repository setup
**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Phase:** Phase 1 - Foundation

**Summary:**
- Created GitHub repository `buckleypaul/giki` using `gh repo create`
- Added remote origin pointing to `git@github.com:buckleypaul/giki.git`
- Pushed initial scaffold to GitHub (main branch)
- Repository description: "A Go CLI tool that turns any git repository into a browsable wiki in the browser"

**Test Results:**
- ✓ `git remote -v` shows GitHub remote (fetch and push)
- ✓ `gh repo view` successfully displays repository information
- ✓ Initial commits pushed to GitHub main branch

**Next Step:** Step 3 - Vite + React scaffold with embed.FS wiring
